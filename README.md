# 🚀 My DSA Journey – Unique Problem-Solving Approaches

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) learning repository!  
This repo is a **curated collection** of DSA problems I’ve solved where the solution involves a **new pattern, unique approach, or important concept** that’s different from problems I’ve solved before.

## 🎯 Purpose

I’m currently in the **learning phase**, and my goal is to:
- Focus on *quality over quantity*
- Document **only those problems that introduce something new** to me
- Reflect deeply on what I learned from each challenge

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Each problem gets its own folder containing:
- `problem.txt` — The **problem statement**
- `solution.cpp` — My **implemented solution**  
  🔹 Inside the code, I include **comments** that explain:
  - Time & space complexity
  - How the approach works
  - What makes it unique or different from similar problems
  - Mistakes (if any) I made during my first attempts
  - Final accepted solution after debugging/improvement

> 🧠 My analysis is written as code comments. If you want to contribute or suggest better approaches, feel free to **comment directly below my analysis in the code**.

## 💬 Community Involvement

I'm open to contributions and corrections!

If you:
- Spot a logical flaw I missed
- Have a better or cleaner solution
- Want to explain an edge case more clearly

Feel free to leave a comment in the code, or open a pull request.

Thanks for visiting my learning repo — hope it helps you as much as it helps me.  
Happy coding! 💻🔥
